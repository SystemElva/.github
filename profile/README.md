# SystemElva

SystemElva is supposed to be a hobbyist operating system  that fits on
a 1.44 MiB (HD) diskette. It isn't  intended to be usable at any point
of time in the  future; much rather, it's supposed to provide fun to a
few developers (currently only one).

It is  being written mainly in  Zig with a little bit of  Assembly for
the parts where it is required, but other languages explicitly are NOT
forbidden, i.e. are allowed. Some languages that  might be interesting
for some parts of the system are:

- Zig  
    Kernel, lowest-level userland
- Rust  
    Majority of userland
- Go  
    Higher-level userland applications
- Lua  
    Shell scripts *could be* Lua-based

As might be visible, the project  tries to use more modern programming
languages rather than the established and tried-good C.
